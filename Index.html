        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1BBY - 4ABY</strong>-Working as The Emperor's Hand, Mara was a secret agent known to few who executed The Emperor's wishes and stomped out traitors within the Empire.

            <strong>4ABY</strong>- With The Emperor destroyed along with the 2nd Death Star, Mara-Jade's life fell apart.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>4ABY - 7ABY</strong>- Mara spent the next few years working odd jobs and manual labor to make ends meet, as well as being on the run from <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysanne_Isard"><i>Ysanne Isard</i></a>. Over time her force abilities also began to fade away, only returning in ill-timed bursts. But her hatred for <i>Skywalker</i> remained, blaming him for destroying her life. She continued to be haunted by the Emperor's last command: <strong><i>"You will kill Luke Skywalker"</i></strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>8ABY</strong>- Mara's luck turned around when she saved the smuggler <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Talon_Karrde"><i>Talon Karrde</i></a>, impressed with Mara's skills Karrde offered Mara a job on the spot. Mara rose quickly through the ranks of Karrde's organization eventually becoming his second in command. 
            Around the same time Mara's force abilities which had laid dormant for the past few years returned when she brought Karrde's freighter, the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Karrde"><i>Wild Karrde</i></a>, out of hyperspace for a routine check where <i>Luke Skywalker's</i> damaged <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/T-65_X-wing_starfighter/Legends">X-Wing</a> was found heavily damaged floating in space.
            <ol><strong>Meeting Skywalker</strong>- Karrde pulled the stranded Jedi aboard and took him back to his base on <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Myrkr/Legends">Myrkr</a>, where the planet's <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysalamir"><i>Ysalamir</i></a> blocked Skywalker's connection to the force. Mara however was intent on killing Skywalker, but Karrde would not allow it. Karrde however kept Skywalker and his astromech droid <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2/Legends">R2-D2</a> locked up and hidden away from view when <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo/Legends"><i>Grand Admiral Thrawn</i></a> arrived to collect <i>ysalamir</i>.
            </ol>

Mara gave chase and a managed to recapture Skywalker after they both crashed in each other forcing them both to land in the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vornskr">vornskr</a>-infested forest. To make matters worst, Thrawn was on Myrkr to harvest ysalamiri, which prevented Mara from contacting Karrde, for the fact that Thrawn would know that Karrde had kept Skywalker from him.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <strong>Forced Alliance</strong>- Mara had wanted to kill Skywalker for years and now she finally had the chance, but Skywalker convinced her that she would need both him and R2 alive to get out of the forrest. Mara begrudgingly agreed and the trio made their way through the forrest to <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hyllyard_City">Hyllyard City</a> over the course of several days fending off multiple vornskr attacks, but they were captured in a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtrooper/Legends">Stormtrooper</a> ambush. Thanks to the timely arrival of Skywalker's friends, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_Solo/Legends"><i>Han Solo</i></a>, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lando_Calrissian/Legends"><i>Lando Calrissian</i></a>, and some of Karrade's men, they defeated the stormtroopers, and Solo, Calrissian, and Skywalker we're allowed to leave Myrkr.
                <ol><strong>Truth and Deceit</strong>- During their journey through the forrest Mara explicitly told Skywalker her intent on killing him and how he ruined her life when Luke and his father <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker/Legends"><i>Darth Vader</i></a> struck down the Emperor. Despite the shocking revelation Luke didn't back away from Mara, instead informing her of what had happened aboard the second Death Star and how Darth Vader saved him by sacrificing himself to throw the Emperor down the airshaft. Despite Mara not believing him Luke left it alone, letting Mara come to a conclusion of her own on what truly happened.
