    <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Mara-Jade Skywalker's life</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>17BBY - 4ABY</strong>- Mara Jade was born at atime of great instability in the Galaxy </li>
            <ol>
                <strong>Early life</strong>- Jade was taken away from her parents at a very young age by <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Palpatine/Legends" target="_blank"><i>The Emperor</i></a> to the planet of Coruscant, where he began training her in the ways of force and grooming her as an agent.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>Becoming Emperor's Hand</strong>- Mara was pushed through an intensive training regimen including training alongside the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor%27s_Royal_Guard/Legends" target="_blank">Imperial Royal Guard</a>, learning covert espionage, and assassination skills, which she became adept by the age of 14. Her final test was to break into <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin/Legends" target="_blank">Grand Moff Tarkin's</a>private quarters, in which she succeeded. Vader and The Emperor, pleased with Mara's skills pronounced her the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor%27s_Hand/Legends#Emperor.27s_Hands" target="_blank">Emperor's Hand</a>. Despite there being other Emperor's Hands, Mara, like the others did not know of each others existence, believing each as the only Emperor's Hand.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>The Emperor's Hand</strong>- As the Emperor's hand, Mara was the Emperor's judge, jury, and executioner, carrying out his will across the galaxy, eliminating corrupt Imperial officials, traitors, and others who he deemed deserving of death or judgment. Due to her deep connection with the force, Mara could hear the Emperor's voice anywhere across the galaxy via a telepathic link. 
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>World Shattered</strong>- While Mara was on vacation she discovered that her last mission to hunt and kill the leader of <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Nebula_(organization)" target="_blank">Black Nebula</a>, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dequc" target="_blank"><i>Dequc</i></a> was too easy. After setting a simulation of the assassination, she came to the conclusion that the person she killed was a decoy, upon realizing this Mara used her Force link with the Emperor to notify him of her findings. But before she was able to contact the Emperor, he projected his demise at the hands of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker for her to see. Mara was overcome by the Emperor's death agonies and rendered unconscious.
            </ol>

        <li>
            <strong>4ABY - 7ABY</strong>- With The Emperor destroyed along with the 2nd Death Star, Mara-Jade's life fell apart. The resources she once had access to were dependent on The Emperor, and her life of luxury. privilege, and purpose was over. But The Emperor left her with one last command: <strong><i>"You will kill Luke Skywalker"</i></strong>
        
            <ol>
            <strong>Lost</strong>- Mara spent the next few years working odd jobs and manual labor to make ends meet, as well as being on the run from <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysanne_Isard" target="_blank"><i>Ysanne Isard</i></a>. Over time her force abilities also began to fade away, only returning in ill-timed bursts. But her hatred for <i>Skywalker</i> remained, blaming him for destroying her life. She continued to be haunted by the Emperor's last command: <strong><i>"You will kill Luke Skywalker"</i></strong>.
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>8ABY</strong>- Mara's luck turned around when she saved the smuggler <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Talon_Karrde"><i>Talon Karrde</i></a>, impressed with Mara's skills Karrde offered Mara a job on the spot. Mara rose quickly through the ranks of Karrde's organization eventually becoming his second in command. 
            Around the same time Mara's force abilities which had laid dormant for the past few years returned when she brought Karrde's freighter, the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Karrde" target="_blank"><i>Wild Karrde</i></a>, out of hyperspace for a routine check where <i>Luke Skywalker's</i> damaged <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/T-65_X-wing_starfighter/Legends">X-Wing</a> was found heavily damaged floating in space.

            <ol>
                <strong>Meeting Skywalker</strong>- Karrde pulled the stranded Jedi aboard and took him back to his base on <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Myrkr/Legends" target="_blank">Myrkr</a>, where the planet's <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysalamir" target="_blank"><i>Ysalamir</i></a> blocked Skywalker's connection to the force. Mara however was intent on killing Skywalker, but Karrde would not allow it. Karrde however kept Skywalker and his astromech droid <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2/Legends" target="_blank">R2-D2</a> locked up and hidden away from view when <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo/Legends"
                target="_blank"><i>Grand Admiral Thrawn</i></a> arrived to collect <i>ysalamir</i>.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>Recapturing Skywalker</strong>- Skywalker managed to escape his cell along with R2-D2 and stole a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/GAT-12_Skipray_Blastboat" target="_blank">Skipray blastboat</a> in an attempt to escape. Mara gave chase and a managed to recapture Skywalker after they both crashed in each other forcing them both to land in the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vornskr" target="_blank">vornskr</a>-infested forest. To make matters worst, Thrawn was on Myrkr to harvest ysalamiri, which prevented Mara from contacting Karrde, for the fact that Thrawn would know that Karrde had kept Skywalker from him.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>Forced Alliance</strong>- Mara had wanted to kill Skywalker for years and now she finally had the chance, but Skywalker convinced her that she would need both him and R2 alive to get out of the forrest. Mara begrudgingly agreed and the trio made their way through the forrest to <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hyllyard_City" target="_blank">Hyllyard City</a> over the course of several days fending off multiple vornskr attacks, but they were captured in a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtrooper/Legends" target="_blank">Stormtrooper</a> ambush. Thanks to the timely arrival of Skywalker's friends, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_Solo/Legends" target="_blank"><i>Han Solo</i></a>, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lando_Calrissian/Legends" target="_blank"><i>Lando Calrissian</i></a>, and some of Karrde's men, they defeated the stormtroopers, and Solo, Calrissian, and Skywalker we're allowed to leave Myrkr.
                    <ol>
                        <strong>Truth and Deceit</strong>- During their journey through the forrest Mara explicitly told Skywalker her intent on killing him and how he ruined her life when Luke and his father <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker/Legends" target="_blank"><i>Darth Vader</i></a> struck down the Emperor. Despite the shocking revelation Luke didn't back away from Mara, instead informing her of what had happened aboard the second Death Star and how Darth Vader saved him by sacrificing himself to throw the Emperor down the airshaft. Despite Mara not believing him Luke left it alone, letting Mara come to a conclusion of her own on what truly happened.
                    </ol>
            </ol>
               
            <ol>
                <strong>Wanted</strong>- Shortly after Myrkr, Karrde and his organization were forced to flee due to a massive Imperial bounty placed upon them by Thrawn. While establishing a new base for Karrde's group on the planet <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rishi/Legends" target="_blank">Rishi</a>, Mara was apprehended by a bounty hunter who she killed shortly after, but this forced Karrde's organization to relocate again.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>Bargain</strong>- Mara was sent to retrieve a ship of Karrde's, the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Etherway" target="_blank">Etherway</a>, but upon her departure a </a> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Victory-class_Star_Destroyer/Legends" target="_blank">Victory-class_Star_Destroyer</a> showed up. Mara realized that Thrawn would not stop hunting them, so she turned herself over to Thrawn. Mara reprised her role as Emperor's Hand offering Thrawn the location of the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Katana_fleet" target="_blank">Katana Fleet</a> in exchange for amnesty for Karrde and his organization. Thrawn agreed and allowed Mara to return to Karrde, but not before placing a tracking beacon on her ship unbeknownst to Mara. Upon arriving at Karrde's new hideout location, Thrawn arrived shortly after Mara and his Imperial Forces captured Talon Karrde.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <strong>Rescue</strong>- Mara was outraged at Thrawn's actions, feeling more loyal to Karrde than ever, she decided <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_on_the_Chimaera" target="_blank"> to break Karrde out</a> aboard Thrawn's capital ship the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_on_the_Chimaera" target="_blank">Chimaera</a>, but she realized she couldn't do it alone and needed the help. Mara made her way to the planet <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jomark/Legends" target="_blank">Jomark</a>, where Luke Skywalker was training under Jedi Master <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Joruus_C%27baoth" target="_blank">Joruus C'baoth</a>. C'boath attempted to knock Mara out of the sky upon her arrival and did his best to prevent her from reaching Luke. R2-D2, controlling Luke's X-wing ferried Mara to Luke's location after she convinced the droid that C'boath was working with the Empire and that Luke owed Karrde.
